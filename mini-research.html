                    <p>
                        This article discusses the ways in which aerospace engineering jobs have evolved since India and Pakistan's 
                        previous war. According to the author, Dr. Amit Kumar Thakur, the war has pushed the need to advance space 
                        technology more strongly, particularly in UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and defense systems based on 
                        Artificial Intelligence to counter enemy movements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can see from the article how classical aerospace engineering has evolved from simply designing aircraft 
                        to being a vital component of national defense policies. The emphasis, according to the article, is on 
                        employing AI-based drones for spying, inspection, and aerial assaults, with the aim of making these 
                        technologies locally so that we are not dependent on foreigners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UAVs are described as tools transformed from auxiliary tools to core combat tools, ranging from combat 
                        drones and battlefield surveillance systems to reconnaissance nano-drones. The education path starts with 
                        a B. Tech in aerospace engineering, followed by specialized master's degrees in areas like AI, UAVs, and 
                        autonomous defense systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Universities like Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Punjab are leading the wave of new aerospace 
                        technologies. Students learn key technical skills such as simulation software, programming languages, and 
                        drone control systems. Career opportunities pass across government agencies like DRDO and HAL, companies 
                        like IdeaForge and Garuda Aerospace, and emerging deep tech startups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The article predicts that by 2030, India will create over 100,000 space related jobs and become a global 
                        leader in UAV technology.

                        <p>
                            This article demonstrates how geopolitical tensions reshape entire fields of scholarship and work. 
                            The career shift of the aerospace engineer outlined here is reflective of larger trends for how 
                            modern war drives technological innovation and the creation of new job categories.

                        <p>
                            This focus on the UAV technology is a shift in military planning and technical priorities. 
                            Pakistan has long taken pride in having the largest stock of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) in 
                            South Asia, owning UAVs largely from Turkey and China, as the only country in this region to 
                            deploy drones as a weapon of war.
