                <p>Dear Reader,</p>
                <p>When you think of summer, you probably picture beaches, pool parties, and ice cream, not essays. But surprisingly, revisiting how I write turned out to be more refreshing than a vacation. Through drafting, receiving feedback from my professor and peers, revising, and reflecting, I’ve realized writing isn’t just putting pen to paper, it’s shaping thought into form. Being able to clearly communicate my ideas, especially when I’m interested in the topic, makes a huge difference.</p>
                <p>In my early drafts, I rarely revised beyond fixing typos or grammar, a habit I picked up in high school. This course pushed me to treat revision seriously, using it to improve my work meaningfully. I used to ignore the reader, writing only for myself. That made my message less effective. This course taught me that considering the reader isn’t just helpful, it’s necessary if I want to write something that connects.</p>
                <p>You might not picture how I used to write before, so here’s a quick rundown based on my first draft of the personal narrative. Imagine an essay starting with the tired hook: “Since the dawn of time, mankind has…” followed by a mess of rambling sentences that ignore the assignment's requirements. The whole thing felt like I just wanted to get it over with. The writing was vague, stuffed with unnecessary metaphors, and I’d throw in fancy words like “juxtaposition” just to sound smart, even if I used them wrong. That was my writing. But after taking this course, my essays look very different.</p>
                <p>Now my writing is more concise. My hooks are stronger. For example, in my final draft I began with: “You have until next Monday,” my physics teacher announced. This kind of opening puts the reader right into the moment. It’s active, specific, and makes you want to know what happens next. My endings have improved too. One example: “Back in the classroom, I blinked. My teacher was…” This kind of close brings the essay full circle, while also ending on a moment that feels thoughtful and real.</p>
                <p>This course has especially helped me improve how I reflect in writing. I used to just tell stories, now I explore my thought process, what I learned, and how I’ve grown. I didn’t expect that reflecting like this would help me better understand myself. I also used to dismiss peer feedback. I’ve learned that it’s more useful than I thought.</p>
                <p>I plan to carry these lessons into my fall semester. Despite the progress made, I still need to work on planning and time management. This course gave me enough time to write, but I still felt rushed, mostly because I underestimated how long writing takes. Good writing needs time and thought. I also want to keep improving how I take feedback. A writer shouldn’t limit themselves to two or three opinions. Getting different perspectives is like hearing from readers, you learn how to make the next thing better.</p>
                <p>With all that said, thank you for taking the time to read, analyze, and learn from my portfolio. I’m confident that everything I’ve learned here will help me handle what comes next.</p>
