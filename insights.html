                    <p class="lead-text">
                        "Engineering isn't just putting metals together. It's structure, the way you think, 
                        how you analyze and troubleshoot under duress."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This realization came to me not in a classroom or laboratory, but during a moment 
                        of personal crisis. When faced with uncertainty and pressure, I discovered that 
                        my mind naturally organized itself into what I now recognize as an engineering 
                        control system.

                    <h3>Structured Thinking Under Pressure</h3>
                    <p>
                        When systems fail or crises emerge, the ability to maintain structured thinking 
                        becomes crucial. Like a control tower scanning for signals, the mind must 
                        organize information systematically, eliminate variables, and track data points 
                        without letting emotions cloud judgment.
                    </p>
                    <div class="insight-example">
                        <strong>Real-world application:</strong> During my brother's disappearance, 
                        I created a mental diagnostic system that gathered data, 
                        eliminated possibilities, and maintained operational clarity.

                    <h3>Learning from System Failures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Failure isn't just about the result, it's about what you do after. Every failure 
                        contains valuable data that can inform future designs and decisions. The key is 
                        to approach failure analytically, not emotionally, treating it as a source of 
                        information rather than disappointment.
                    </p>
                    <div class="insight-example">
                        <strong>Real-world application:</strong> When my drone enhancement project 
                        resulted in overheating and fire, I analyzed every decision and component 
                        to understand why it failed.

                    <p>
                        Engineering principles extend far beyond technical projects. The same systematic 
                        approach used to design spacecraft can be applied to personal challenges, 
                        decision-making, and problem-solving in any field. Every problem is a system 
                        that can be analyzed and optimized.

                    <p>
                        Aerospace represents the ultimate combination of function, motion, logic, and 
                        timing. In space, there are no second chances, every system must work flawlessly, 
                        every component must serve its purpose, and every decision must be calculated 
                        and precise. This demands the highest level of engineering excellence.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Personal connection:</strong> My fascination with how signals travel, 
                        how systems fail and reboot, and how complex systems maintain functionality 
                        under extreme conditions drives my passion for aerospace engineering.

                        I want to contribute to the design of systems that must function

                        a system, every spacecraft is a collection of interconnected components.
